# 🥄 Self-Stabilizing Spoon for Parkinson’s Patients

A smart spoon designed to reduce hand tremors for Parkinson’s patients using a gyroscope and servo stabilization system. Built with Arduino and 3D-printed components.

## 💡 Features
- Real-time motion stabilization
- Gyroscope + servo motor control
- Rechargeable battery system
- 3D-printed ergonomic design

## 🧠 Tech Used
- Arduino Uno
- MPU6050 Gyroscope
- MG90S Servo Motors
- Python for calibration
- Fusion 360 for 3D design

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `/software`: Arduino + Python code
- `/hardware`: Circuit diagrams, CAD files, parts list
- `/images`: Demo photos and build process

## 🚀 How to Build
1. Assemble the circuit as shown in `circuit_diagram.png`
2. Upload `arduino_code.ino` to the Arduino
3. Run the calibration script (`calibration_script.py`)
4. Print the enclosure using `CAD_model.stl`
